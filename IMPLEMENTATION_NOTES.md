### ⚠️ Known Limitations

1. **Historical Intraday Data**
   - yfinance only provides last ~60 days of intraday data
   - Solution: Use Kite Connect historical API, NSE archives, or paid providers
   - Current fallback: Simulate intraday bars from daily data (disclosed in outputs)

2. **Simulated Data Quality**
   - Simulated intraday bars are approximations
   - May not capture true intraday volatility patterns
   - Can lead to unrealistic backtest results
   - Strategy may not generate trades on simulated data

3. **Computational Constraints**
   - Testing >1M combinations requires significant compute time
   - Full optimization estimated 6-12 hours on modern hardware
   - Current implementation limits to manageable subsets for testing

4. **Market Data Gaps**
   - No handling for stock splits, dividends, or corporate actions
   - Assumes continuous trading (no holidays/gaps)
   - yfinance data quality varies by symbol

## Production Deployment Checklist

### Data Requirements

- [ ] **Obtain Real Intraday Data**
  - Use Zerodha Kite Connect historical API
  - Or subscribe to commercial data provider (AlphaVantage, Quandl, etc.)
  - Or download NSE historical data archives
  - Minimum: 10 years of 5-minute OHLCV data

- [ ] **Data Quality Checks**
  - Verify no missing bars during trading hours (9:15 AM - 3:30 PM)
  - Check for outliers/errors in OHLCV data
  - Adjust for corporate actions (splits, dividends, bonuses)
  - Validate volume data (filter low liquidity periods)

### Optimization Strategy

- [ ] **Phase 1: Initial Exploration (Genetic Algorithm)**
  - Test 10,000-50,000 combinations
  - Identify promising parameter regions
  - Estimated time: 2-4 hours

- [ ] **Phase 2: Refinement (Grid Search)**
  - Focus on best regions from Phase 1
  - Test 100,000-500,000 combinations
  - Estimated time: 6-12 hours

- [ ] **Phase 3: Validation**
  - Walk-forward analysis on top 10 parameter sets
  - Test across different market regimes
  - Monte Carlo simulation for confidence intervals
  - Estimated time: 4-6 hours

### Risk Management

- [ ] **Position Sizing**
  - Never risk more than 1-2% per trade
  - Maximum portfolio allocation: 20% per symbol
  - Maintain minimum 50% cash reserve

- [ ] **Stop-Loss Rules**
  - Always use stop-losses (never disable)
  - Consider ATR-based dynamic stops
  - Implement time-based stops (exit after N bars if no profit)

- [ ] **Trade Filters**
  - Minimum liquidity: 50k shares/day average volume
  - Maximum 200 trades/year (practical limit for Zerodha)
  - Avoid trading in first/last 15 minutes (high volatility)

### Live Trading Setup

- [ ] **Kite Connect Configuration**
  ```python
  # Get API credentials from https://developers.kite.trade/
  API_KEY = "your_api_key"
  API_SECRET = "your_api_secret"
  
  # Generate access token daily
  # Note: Tokens expire at 7:30 AM IST daily
  ```

- [ ] **Paper Trading First**
  - Test strategy in paper trading mode for 1 month
  - Verify signal generation matches backtests
  - Check execution timing and slippage

- [ ] **Start Small**
  - Begin with ₹10,000 - ₹50,000 capital
  - Trade only 1-2 symbols initially
  - Gradually scale up after 3 months of success

- [ ] **Monitoring and Alerts**
  - Setup email/SMS alerts for:
    - Trade executions
    - Stop-loss hits
    - API connection failures
    - Unusual returns (>5% in a day)
  - Daily review of trades and P&L

### Performance Tracking

- [ ] **Daily Metrics**

  - Trades executed vs signals generated
  - Slippage (actual vs backtested execution)
  - Commission/charges

- [ ] **Weekly Metrics**
  - Win rate
  - Average win/loss
  - Maximum drawdown
  - Sharpe ratio

- [ ] **Monthly Review**

  - Compare actual vs backtested performance
  - Adjust position sizing if needed

## Recommended Improvements

### Priority 1: Critical for Production

1. **Real Intraday Data Integration**

   logging.basicConfig(
       filename='strategy.log',
       level=logging.INFO,
       format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s'
   )
   ```

3. **Error Handling and Recovery**

## Cost-Benefit Analysis

### Expected Returns

Based on literature and industry standards for SMA strategies:

- **Conservative Estimate**: 8-12% annualized return above risk-free rate
- **Moderate Estimate**: 12-18% annualized return
- **Optimistic Estimate**: 18-25% annualized return

**Important**: These are aspirational targets. Actual results may vary significantly.

### Costs

1. **Development Time**: 40-80 hours (already completed)
2. **Data Costs**: ₹0 - ₹10,000/year (depending on provider)
3. **Transaction Costs**: 0.05-0.13% per trade (Zerodha)
4. **Slippage**: ~0.05-0.1% per trade (market impact)
5. **Infrastructure**: ₹500-5,000/month (VPS, monitoring tools)

### Break-Even Analysis

For ₹1,00,000 capital:
- Annual transaction costs: ~₹1,000-5,000 (assuming 100-200 trades/year)
- Infrastructure: ~₹6,000-60,000/year
- Total costs: ~₹7,000-65,000/year

**Required return to break-even**: 7-65% (depending on infrastructure choices)

With 200 trades/year at avg cost of ₹50/trade: ₹10,000/year = 10% of capital

## Regulatory and Compliance

### SEBI Guidelines

- [ ] **Algo Trading Registration** (if using automated execution)
  - Required for institutional/professional traders
  - Not required for personal trading accounts
  - Consult with compliance expert if trading >₹25 lakhs

- [ ] **Record Keeping**
  - Maintain trade logs for 5 years
  - Document strategy logic and parameters
  - Keep audit trail of all modifications

- [ ] **Risk Disclosures**
  - Understand that past performance ≠ future results
  - Be aware of market risks
  - Never invest more than you can afford to lose

## Conclusion

This implementation provides a solid foundation for SMA crossover strategy development and testing. However, **production deployment requires:**

1. **Real historical data** (not simulated)
2. **Extensive testing** (walk-forward, regime analysis, stress testing)
3. **Proper risk management** (position sizing, stops, limits)
4. **Continuous monitoring** (performance tracking, parameter reoptimization)

**Do not deploy to live trading without:**
- At least 3 months of paper trading
- Verification with real historical data
- Proper understanding of risks involved
- Adequate capital reserves
