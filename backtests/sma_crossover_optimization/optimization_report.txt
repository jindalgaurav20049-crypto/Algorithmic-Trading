RECOMMENDATIONS FOR LIVE TRADING
================================================================================
Position Sizing:
  - Use fixed fractional sizing at 1% risk per trade
  - Calculate position size based on stop-loss distance
  - Example: If account = $100,000, risk = $1,000 per trade
  - With 0.00% stop-loss, position size = Risk / Stop-loss

Risk Management:
  - Never risk more than 2% of capital on any single trade
  - Use the optimized stop-loss and take-profit levels
  - Monitor maximum holding period to avoid overexposure
  - Review strategy performance monthly

Execution:
  - Use limit orders to minimize slippage
  - Execute trades at market close or next market open
  - Account for 0.1% transaction costs in all calculations

WARNINGS AND RISKS
================================================================================
1. OVERFITTING RISK:
   The parameters are optimized on historical data and may not
   perform as well in future market conditions.

2. MARKET REGIME SHIFTS:
   Strategy performance varies across different market regimes.
   Bull markets may favor different parameters than bear markets.

3. TRANSACTION COSTS:
   High-frequency trading (>100 trades/year) can erode returns
   due to cumulative transaction costs and slippage.

4. SLIPPAGE:
   Real-world execution prices may differ from backtest prices,
   especially during volatile markets or with large positions.

5. BLACK SWAN EVENTS:
   The strategy may not protect against extreme market events
   not present in the historical data.

6. PARAMETER STABILITY:
   Review sensitivity analysis to understand how parameter
   variations affect performance. Unstable parameters may
   indicate overfitting.
