## 🎯 Strategy Overview

### What is Index Front-Running?

Index front-running is a strategy that anticipates and trades ahead of large passive fund rebalances. When NSE announces semi-annual constituent changes to the Nifty 50 Index:

- **Stocks being ADDED** → Passive funds must BUY → Price rises
- **Stocks being REMOVED** → Passive funds must SELL → Price falls

**Our Edge:** We enter positions AFTER announcement but BEFORE effective date, capturing the temporary price inefficiency caused by predictable passive fund flows.

### Target Opportunity

- **Frequency:** Semi-annual (February/August announcements for March/September effective dates)
- **Market:** NSE (National Stock Exchange of India)
- **Instruments:** Individual Nifty 50 constituent stocks
- **Holding Period:** Short-term (days to weeks)
- **Expected Trades:** ~20-40 per year (depending on rebalance activity)

---

## 💡 Why This Works

### Market Inefficiency Exploited

1. **Predictable Flows:** Passive funds tracking Nifty 50 (e.g., NIFTYBEES.NS ETF, various mutual funds) hold over ₹50,000 crores in assets
2. **Forced Rebalancing:** These funds MUST adjust holdings on/near the effective date regardless of price
3. **Front-Running Window:** Time gap between announcement and effective date creates a tradeable opportunity
4. **Price Impact:** Large institutional buying/selling causes temporary price movements

### Historical Evidence

- Studies show 2-8% average price impact during index rebalancing periods
- Addition announcements typically see +3-5% price moves
- Removal announcements typically see -2-4% price moves
- Edge diminishes as market becomes aware (crowding risk)

### Why Indian Markets?

- **Less Efficient:** Indian retail-dominated markets show stronger rebalancing effects than developed markets
- **Growing Passive AUM:** Rapid growth in Indian ETFs/index funds increases flow magnitudes
- **Regulatory Timing:** NSE's predictable semi-annual schedule allows preparation

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### Parameter Optimization

The strategy optimizes over **>1 million parameter combinations**:

| Parameter | Range | Values | Description |
|-----------|-------|--------|-------------|
| `entry_days_post_announcement` | 0-10 days | 11 | Days after announcement to enter |
| `exit_days_post_effective` | 0-10 days | 11 | Days after effective date to exit |
| `position_size_pct` | 0.5-5% | 10 | Capital allocation per stock |
| `stop_loss_pct` | 0-10% | 21 | Maximum loss threshold |
| `take_profit_pct` | 0-15% | 16 | Target profit exit |
| `flow_filter_cr` | ₹100-1000 cr | 10 | Minimum estimated flow to trade |
| `trade_mode` | CNC/MIS | 2 | Delivery or intraday |

**Total Combinations:** 11 × 11 × 10 × 21 × 16 × 10 × 2 = **1,832,320**

The optimizer uses:
- **Grid Search:** Systematic sampling of parameter space
- **Genetic Algorithms:** Evolutionary optimization (optional enhancement)
- **Walk-Forward Validation:** 7-year in-sample, 3-year out-of-sample

### Transaction Cost Model

#### CNC (Delivery) Charges
```
Brokerage: ₹0
STT: 0.1% on buy and sell
Transaction Charges: 0.00297% on buy and sell

api_secret = "your_api_secret"
kite = KiteConnect(api_key=api_key)

# Generate login URL
login_url = kite.login_url()
print(f"Login here: {login_url}")

# After login, you'll get request_token from redirect URL
request_token = "your_request_token"

# Generate access token
data = kite.generate_session(request_token, api_secret=api_secret)
access_token = data["access_token"]
kite.set_access_token(access_token)

print("Authentication successful!")
```

### Step 4: Place Orders

#### Long Position (Stock Addition)
```python
# Buy order for stock being added to index
order_id = kite.place_order(
    variety=kite.VARIETY_REGULAR,
    exchange=kite.EXCHANGE_NSE,
    tradingsymbol="DIXON",  # Without .NS suffix
    transaction_type=kite.TRANSACTION_TYPE_BUY,
    quantity=10,
    product=kite.PRODUCT_CNC,  # Delivery
    order_type=kite.ORDER_TYPE_LIMIT,
    price=5000.0,
    validity=kite.VALIDITY_DAY
)

# Optional: Set stop-loss
sl_order_id = kite.place_order(
    variety=kite.VARIETY_REGULAR,
    exchange=kite.EXCHANGE_NSE,
    tradingsymbol="DIXON",
    transaction_type=kite.TRANSACTION_TYPE_SELL,

    price=1000.0,
    validity=kite.VALIDITY_DAY
)
```

### Step 5: Monitor Positions

```python
# Get current positions
positions = kite.positions()

# Get order history
orders = kite.orders()

# Get holdings
holdings = kite.holdings()
```

### Step 6: Webhook for NSE Announcements

For live trading, set up monitoring for NSE rebalance announcements:

```python
import requests
from datetime import datetime

def check_nse_announcements():
    """
    Monitor NSE website for index rebalance announcements
    URL: https://www.niftyindices.com/reports/historical-data
    """
    # This would require web scraping or RSS feed monitoring
    # Check twice daily during announcement windows (Jan-Feb, Jul-Aug)
    pass

# Schedule checks
import schedule
schedule.every().day.at("09:30").do(check_nse_announcements)
schedule.every().day.at("15:30").do(check_nse_announcements)
```

## ⚠️ Risk Management

### Strategy Risks

1. **Announcement Timing Risk**
   - NSE may delay or change announcement dates
   - **Mitigation:** Monitor NSE communications actively

2. **Crowded Trade Risk**
   - Strategy becomes less effective as more traders use it
   - **Mitigation:** Continuously monitor performance degradation

3. **Execution Risk**
   - Liquidity may be poor during rebalancing
   - **Mitigation:** Use limit orders, check average daily volume

4. **Short Squeeze Risk**
   - Removed stocks may rally instead of falling
   - **Mitigation:** Strict stop-losses, position sizing

5. **Regulatory Risk**
   - SEBI may change front-running rules or rebalancing procedures
   - **Mitigation:** Stay updated with regulatory changes

6. **Data Quality Risk**
   - Historical rebalance data may be incomplete
   - **Mitigation:** Cross-verify with multiple sources

### Position Sizing Guidelines

- **Maximum per stock:** 5% of capital (optimized parameter)
- **Maximum total exposure:** 30-40% during rebalance window
- **Liquidity filter:** Only trade stocks with >1 lakh shares/day average volume
- **Flow filter:** Only trade if estimated fund flows >₹500 crores

### Stop-Loss Rules

- **Individual stop-loss:** 5-10% (parameter-dependent)
- **Portfolio stop-loss:** If total drawdown exceeds 15%, halt trading
- **Time-based exit:** Always exit by exit_days_post_effective date regardless of P&L

## 🚀 Live Trading Considerations

### Pre-Live Checklist

- [ ] Verify Zerodha API credentials and access token
- [ ] Test order placement on paper trading account
- [ ] Set up real-time NSE announcement monitoring
- [ ] Configure position sizing based on actual capital
- [ ] Enable stop-loss orders for all positions
- [ ] Set up daily P&L tracking and alerting
- [ ] Prepare for margin requirements (especially for shorts)

### Operational Workflow

1. **Announcement Phase (Jan-Feb, Jul-Aug)**
   - Monitor NSE website daily at 9:30 AM and 3:30 PM
   - Check for Nifty 50 constituent change announcements
   
2. **Analysis Phase (Within 24 hours of announcement)**
   - Identify added and removed stocks
   - Estimate expected fund flows (based on ETF/fund AUM)
   - Calculate optimal entry timing using backtested parameters
   
3. **Entry Phase (Days after announcement)**
   - Place limit orders for long positions (additions)
   - Place short orders for removal stocks (check availability)
   - Set stop-loss orders immediately after execution
   
4. **Monitoring Phase (Until exit date)**
   - Track daily P&L
   - Monitor for stop-loss or take-profit triggers
   - Watch for news that might affect individual stocks
   
5. **Exit Phase (Days after effective date)**
   - Close all positions by predetermined exit date
   - Document trades for post-analysis
   - Calculate realized P&L including all costs

## 🔍 Strategy Applicability

### Other Indian Indices

This strategy can be adapted to:
- **Nifty Next 50** - Second tier of large caps
- **Nifty Bank** - Banking sector index
- **Nifty Midcap 150** - Mid-cap stocks
- **Nifty Smallcap 250** - Small-cap stocks

### Key Adjustments Needed

1. **Liquidity:** Smaller indices have lower liquidity → adjust position sizes
2. **AUM:** Less passive tracking → smaller price impacts
3. **Frequency:** Some indices rebalance quarterly vs. semi-annually
4. **Volatility:** Mid/small caps more volatile → adjust stop-losses
